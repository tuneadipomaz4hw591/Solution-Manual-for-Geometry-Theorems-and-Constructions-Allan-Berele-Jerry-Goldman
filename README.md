--------------------


* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0130871214
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0130871213
  * * Author: College Geometry
   
  * College Geometry offers readers a deep understanding of the basic results in plane geometry and how they are used. Its unique coverage helps readers master Euclidean geometry, in preparation for non- Euclidean geometry. Focus on plane Euclidean geometry, reviewing high school level geometry and coverage of more advanced topics equips readers with a thorough understanding of Euclidean geometry, needed in order to understand non-Euclidean geometry. Coverage of Spherical Geometry in preparation for introduction of non-Euclidean geometry. A strong emphasis on proofs is provided, presented in various levels of difficulty and phrased in the manner of present-day mathematicians, helping the reader to focus more on learning to do proofs by keeping the material less abstract. For readers pursuing a career in mathematics.
